# SQL-for-Healthcare


In this Exploratory Data Analysis project, I make use of simple SQL queries to delve into a hospital patients' database, with the aim of finding answers to questions such as:
• Top 10 patients with the most visits to the hospital
• The cities with up to 50 counts of emergency cases
• The number of patients from different cities who came in different years
• The top recurring conditions
• The month with the highest number of ambulatory cases and emergency cases
• Top 15 years with the most immunizations
• Number of times each medical procedure was carried out in the hospital
• And so many more Exploratory Data Analysis questions
